## Feature Example - Extend GraphQL Schema to enable subscriptions

This example demonstrates how to extend the GraphQL API provided by Keystone to add subscriptions with custom context and authentication. For more information on Subscriptions see https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions

The example has the following two subscriptions setup

### Time

Continuously sends the current time every second

```gql
subscription Time {
  time {
    iso
  }
}
```

### Post Published

This subscription receives a post every time the custom `publishPost` mutation is called.

```gql
subscription PublishedPost {
  postPublished {
    id
    title
    publishDate
  }
}
```

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `yarn` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this link in a browser to create your first user.

### Subscriptions Page

Once you have created your first user and a post or two, open the [/subscriptions](http://localhost:3000/subscriptions) page in another tab. Here you will see the time feed changing every second in response to the time subscription, as well as an update whenever a post is published.

## Publish a Post

After you create a post, on the post item page there is a button labeled "Publish Post". Clicking this will set the status to `Published` set the `publishDate` to `now()` and send the post to the `postPublished` subscription.
